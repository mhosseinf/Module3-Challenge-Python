#PyBank includes 2 folders and 1 Python script:
1-Resource folder contains a financial dataset, The associated file is called budget_data.csv
2-PyBank-Outputs folder contains a text file that has the results from the Python script.

#PyPoll includes 2 folders and 1 Python script:
1-Resource folder contains a set of poll data. The associated file is called election_data.csv
2-PyPoll-Outputs folder contains a text file that has the results from the Python script.


#I created a folder named "Results/PyPoll-Outputs" to store the initial results. However, I decided not to delete this folder after rearranging the files. even after I moved all the result files to the same folder where the dataset is located to preserve the history of commits, allowing me to showcase the chronological evolution of the scripts and the step-by-step improvements made to each script within the same folder. This approach ensures that I can effectively demonstrate the historical changes, script enhancements, and iterative development process throughout the project.
