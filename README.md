#PyBank includes 2 folders and 1 Python script:
1-Resource folder contains a financial dataset, The associated file is called budget_data.csv
2-PyBank-Outputs folder contains a text file that has the results from the Python script.

#PyPoll includes 2 folders and 1 Python script:
1-Resource folder contains a set of poll data. The associated file is called election_data.csv
2-PyPoll-Outputs folder contains a text file that has the results from the Python script.


#I created a folder named "Results/PyPoll-Outputs" to store the initial results. However, I realised that results need to be located in the same folder where the dataset is located, so I rearrange the files and move scripts for both PayBank and PyPoll into the same folder. I feel like this action deleted the history of the evolution of the scripts and the step-by-step improvements made to each script.
